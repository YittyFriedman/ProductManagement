# Product Management

Product Management Project is a web based project which was created using ASP.NET and using the MVC framework.
<br /><br />Product Management is divided into 3 modules:
1) ADD: The Add module allows users to add new products to a database. The system allows you to add in all the product descriptions and product variants. Once the information is recorded the system will generate unique product id's for each variant combination so that the product id's can be easily grouped by product family and be user friendly at the same time. 
2) MANAGE: The Manage module allows users to modify any existing item which was entered.
3) APPROVE: The Approve module allows the managers to a) approve an item and add it to the old systems database b) dissapprove an item - which will send a notifacation the creater letting them know that the item was dissapproved and why c) edit an item - which can modify any item created which was not yet approved.

Please note: The project is created with a mock database so all saving, editing, deleting etc. will not be recording and you will only see the demo data which is hardcoded into the code.
